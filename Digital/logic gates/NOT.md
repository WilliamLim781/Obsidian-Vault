## Symbol
one thing to note is that if you tie the Input of either a [[NOR]] or a [[NAND]] you will also get a NOT gate.

## Transistor form
Nothing much to talk about here signal goes into both a PMOS and a NMOS which means only one of the gates are open at a time. PMOS is with $V_{dd}$ and NMOS with GND so that it behaves like an inversion of CLK
