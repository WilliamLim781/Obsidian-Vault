## 1.)What is the resonance frequency of a series or parallel RLC circuit?

$$f_{o} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$$


## 2.) What's the difference between a series and parallel RLC circuit in terms of impedance and behavior at resonance?
when it comes to the equations used to find the resonance frequency of either a parallel or a series it is the same equation. when it comes to the impedance of the circuit there are a few differences. However, at resonance both a series and parallel circuit have an impedance of $Z = R$

### Parallel
resonance is when $Z = R$ which means that the capacitor and inductor have canceled each other out so only the resistance remains. But how does this impedance compare to the impedances at different frequencies?. When looking at a parallel circuit the impedance is actually at its maximum as the equations for the impedance is
$$\frac{1}{Z_{tot}} = \frac{1}{Z_{r}} + \frac{1}{Z_{c}}+\frac{1}{Z_{l}} $$
we also know that the resulting impedance will be smaller than all of the impedances in a parallel circuit. so at resonance, you loose the capacitor and inductor impedance which removes the the there contributions to the parallel resistance and only leaves R which makes the impedance at resonance the largest it will ever be in the RLC parallel circuit


### Series
the series impedance would be
$$Z_{tot} = Z_{R} + Z_{C} + Z_{L}$$
at resonance, capacitor and inductor impedances cancel each other out so they no long play a role in the impedance of the Series RLC circuit. This makes the impedance of the circuit the smallest it will be at its resonance frequency.
