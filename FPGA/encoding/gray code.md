Gray code is a [[encoding]] technique where successive binary values only differ by one 1 bit for for example "00" got to "01". Moving from "00" to "01" is on a one bit difference(Right is the only value that changed from 0 to 1).![[gray code.png]]

The image above demonstrates the order of gray code by the number of bits available. Note that the first half of gray code(n/2) is the same as the second half of the gray code but reflected. This property gives it the name of "reflected binary code"

## why use gray code?
gray code is a common tool used in error detection and bit repair. Basically it a way to ensure that data is correct and allows for errors to be detected.
