## What is it?
a Finite State Machine is a graphical model that demonstrates how a circuit will behave given a certain criteria(State). Each section of the FSM is a unique state that the circuit will exhibit. a stimulus will then cause the Circuit to change state depending on the stimulus applied to the circuit

## what is it used for ?
FSM are used to define all possible states that a circuit would exhibit and under what conditions it would it needs to enter into a certain state. It is  basically a means of mapping out all of the behaviors a circuit will go through and how to get that circuit to to exhibit that said behavior. It is a good way of fully mapping out a logic behind a circuit to make it easier to design and more stable as each behavior is full defined in the circuit.

## Design
FSM are created before any HDL or code is created. It serves as a blueprint on how logic should be written and structured. It basically allows for the designer to iron out all of the logic and behavior of the circuit before prototyping. This way, it ensures that the circuit is well planned out before and major effort is put into creating and prototyping the circuit.
