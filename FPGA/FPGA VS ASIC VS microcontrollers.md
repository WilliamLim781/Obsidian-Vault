## FPGA
	- Most customizable as you can adjust them on a transistor level
	- Expensive in general so used generally in low volume applications
	- Faster than Microcontroller but tend to be slower than ASIC
	- are rather complex to use
	- tend to consume more power than their microcontroller or asic counterparts

## ASIC
	- Least customizable (hardwired electroncics for specific/niche applications)
	- Really high upfront cost but as volume increases, cost per unit decreases 
	upfront cost doesn't impact the whole cost as much
	- can be optimized to be faster than FPGAs and microcontrollers 
	- are really complex to use. designs are set in stone so many verifications 
	 are needed to make sure everything behaves as expected
	- can be optimized to be the most power efficient

## microcontrollers
	- more customizable than an ASIC but less customizable than a FPGA
	- generally the cheapest of the three untill very high volumes as ASIC end up          being cheaper
	- generally the slowest of the three
	- simplest of the three to use
	- more power efficient than a FPGA be less efficient than a ASIC
