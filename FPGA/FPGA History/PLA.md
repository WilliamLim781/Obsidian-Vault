Programmable Logic Array (PLA) are a type of PLD that has a **Programmable** AND gate array followed by a **programmable** OR gate array. Leading to a more "Customizable" PLD that can support combinations of boolean expressions. The issue with more programmability is that there are potentially more resistance and parasitic capacitances on the longer wires that enable it to be more programmable. Resulting in potentially slower operating speeds and more silicon die space used in comparison to a similar sized [[PAL]] device
