Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) is a device that consists of multiple programmable logic blocks that are interconnected through a programmable interconnect matrix. So basically it is multiple [[GAL]]/[[ PAL]] grouped together in a matrix. These [[GAL]]/[[PAL]] inputs and outputs can then be connected to each other via the programmable interconnected matrix.
