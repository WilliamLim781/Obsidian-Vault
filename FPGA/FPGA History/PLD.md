Programmable logic devices(PLD) is the more generic descriptor for what a FPGA. It is basically a reference *hardware* that is *programmable*. Its important to note that PLDs, are different from microprocessor as microprocessors *hardware* is fixed while a PLD *hardware* can be altered/programmed.

## Microprocessor vs PLD
a microprocessor is a processor that has fixed hardware but can be programmed to complete different task using the given fixed hardware. A PLD on the other hand, utilized hardware that can but altered and combined to complete different tasks. So the fundamental difference between the two is how each is "programmed" to achieve their tasks. A microprocessor is programmable instructions (software instructions) using the fixed hardware to complete the tasks needed. In a FPGA the actual hardware is altered and connections between blocks are changed to complete the desired tasks.
