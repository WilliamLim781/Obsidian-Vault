Field programmable Gate Arrays(FPGA) is the most widely used technology in modern day. It replaced the [[AND]] and [[OR]] gate arrays with the more compact [[LUT]]. In addition the use of [[SRAM]] instead of [[FLASH]] for configuration was used in FPGAs.

## why are FPGAs used?
there are many different reasons to use an FPGA but a few of them are
- they allow for the constructions of solutions that would generally be technically inferior or economically unviable with other approaches. An good example of this is the in the Defense sector. FPGAs are widely used instead of ASICs because of the generally low volume of product manufactured. ASICs could perform better but they don't make sense economically as the low production volumes would mean the cost of one ASIC would be too high. Also the ever changing nature of Defense allows for FPGA to be useful as they can be updated/adapted to modern defense needs.
- solutions can also be tailored exactly to their needs. Since they are customizable to the hardware level, the whole solution can be tailored to the exact needs. Take DSP, digital effects, and modeling amplifiers. an FPGA can be used to create different effects specifically tailored to the wants of the consumer
- Designs can be generally faster than lets say an ASIC design. Potentially slower than a MCU design but in solutions where the speed of an FPGA is needed, FPGAs can generally be in a faster design process.
- designs can be easily modified. Similar to the Defense industry example that I used. FPGA can be modified on the go(hence the Field programmable in FPGA) allowing for the FPGA to adapt to the current needs.
