Programmable Array Logic (PAL) is a type of PLD that utilizes a **programmable** AND gate array followed by a **Non-Programmable** OR gate array. This results in a "Less" customizable PLD but reduces the resistances and parasitic capacitances between the connection on the OR gate connection. Resulting in potentially faster operating speeds and potentially taking less silicon die space in comparison to a similar sized [[PLA]] device
