| programmable AND Gates(fixed OR Gates)                                     | Programmable AND and OR gates                                                       |
| OR gates are hardwired so predetermined number of product terms it can sum | OR gates are not hardwired so you can decide how much product terms you want to sum |
| Simpler (OR gates are fixed)                                               | complex( OR gates are programmable)                                                 |

| Less flexible but sufficient for most practical applications               | More flexible but is more capable                                                   |
