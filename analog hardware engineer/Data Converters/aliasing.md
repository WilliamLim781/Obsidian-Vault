In a general Aliasing is the term when a signal is sampled that is above the Nyquist frequency this causes the signal to fold ([[Fan Folding]])into zone 1(0 - Nyquist Frequency) and be read by the ADC as a different frequency. This can cause issues if there is already a signal in that frequency component that is being sampled, then both signals are sampled together which can cause a problem as it isn't trivial to distinguish the signal from each other.
