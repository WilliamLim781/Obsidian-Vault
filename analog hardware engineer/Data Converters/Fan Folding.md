![[Fan folding picture.png]]
this is the idea that there is a long piece of paper that contains segments and the whole piece of paper is folded over each other on these segments. The segments are based on the Nyquist frequency so you can see that the first segment goes from 0 to $\frac{F_{s}}{2}$ and every segment is another $\frac{F_{s}}{2}$ apart. all signals and frequency components that the ADC is expecting can then be plotted on the fan-fold paper. The paper is then folded together and all the signals collapse into one page. This folding is indicative of how signals will start  [[aliasing]] with each other
