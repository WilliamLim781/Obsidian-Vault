In circuit theory, we really only see two different types of capacitor unpolarized and polarized, but in reality, there are many more capacitors with different use cases.

## Ceramic capacitors
Ceramic capacitors are type of unpolarized capacitor hat is divided into two different classes **class I** or **class II**.
- **class I** have a high stability and low losses. These capacitors are typically used for resonant circuit applications. they are often classified as C0G/NP0
- **class II** typically offer high volumetric efficiency(basically more capacitance) and are use typically used for buffer, by-pass, and coupling applications. often classified as X7R, Y5V. This does come at the draw back of having more variation with temperature

## Electrolytic capacitors
Electrolytic capacitors are a type of polarized capacitor and are typically used in larger circuits. 

| Pros                                  | Cons                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| High capacitance in small size        | Large ESR(not for high frequency)                   |
| Inexpensive                           | Limited life-span(especially under heat and stress) |
| widely used in power supply filtering | leakage current                                     |
These capacitors are typically used in power and energy storage/ supply, input and output filtering in things like regulators, and low frequency decoupling.

## Tantalum capacitors
Tantalum capacitors are another type of polarized capacitor

| Pros                                                | Con                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| More stable and smaller than aluminum electrolytics | Expensive                                           |
| Lower ESR than aluminum caps                        | can fail short(catastrophically if stressed)        |
| Very stable over temperature and voltage            | Limited to lower capacitances compared to aluminum  |
| longer life                                         |                                                     |
These will be used in more space-constrained power filtering like smart  phones precision decoupling and maybe military/aerospace where stability is more important.

## Film capacitors
 plastic film capacitors, film dielectric capacitors, polymer film capacitors are all generally called film capacitors or power film capacitors. They tend to be blockier in form factor than other capacitors and are generally unpolarized capacitors.

| Pros                               | Con                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Very stable and precise            | Bulkier than ceramics        |
| Very low ESR and ESL               | More expensive than ceramics |
| Excellent for AC signals           |                              |
| Long life and high voltage ratings |                              |
These capacitors are more common is Audio circuits, Power electronics(snubbers, EMI filtering, etc),high-voltage AC applications, and precision analog circuits.

## Mica capacitors
Mica capacitors are high, precision, stable, and reliable capacitors which are made from mica. They are typically used in high frequency circuits or cases where a low losses(High Q )and low capacitor change over time is important.

| pros                           | cons                    |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Very stable                    | Expensive               |
| Low loss                       | Lower capacitance range |
| High precision and reliability |                         |
These capacitors are typically used in RF applications, High-frequency timing, and test and measurements.
