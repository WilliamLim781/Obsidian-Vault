integrator is a type of inverting amplifier but this time the typically purely resistance feedback system is replaced with a capacitance. The purpose of the this op amp is to mimic the mathematical operation of integration on a signal.  The idea is that since the capacitor is variable with time the gain will change with different frequencies. for $V_{out} = \frac{x_{c}}{r_{in}}$  so at dc the capacitor behaves as an open circuit so there is no feedback but at higher frequencies the feedback loop is complete and will amplify said signal at that frequency
