Common Op-amp Topology that is used to add voltage [[gain(TODO)]] to a signal. The Topology has the signal go through the negative input of the op-amp and also contains negative feedback to make it so the gain is influenced/controlled by external components; Allowing for control on the amount of voltage gain induced onto a signal.

The red signal is the input and the green signal is the output. the output(green )is phase shifted 180° from the original signal(red), Inverting the output in relation to the input. Gain equation can also de defined as
$$Vout = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{in}}$$
where $R_{f}$ is the resistance on the feedback network and $R_{in}$ is the resistor network at input where the signal goes through.
