a voltage follower circuit also known as a buffer is a circuit that provides a high input impedance but a low output impedance. It circuit acts as a "buffer" between stages of a circuit. This buffer makes it so that each stages don't get indirectly influenced by each other so the stages can behave independent from each other. Which means that the buffer just copies the signal from the first stage and outputs it to the second stage.

The picture is from Falstad and demonstrates the behavior of a voltage follower. The 100 ohm resistance is just used as Falstad doesn't allow short circuits so 100 ohms as a current limiter.  The left oscilloscope reading is the output and the right output is the input signal. Which demonstrates that the output and input are exact same the buffer is just used to "separate" the two different stages from each other.
