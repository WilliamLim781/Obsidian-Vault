Voltage also known as "Electrical Potential difference", "Electric pressure", "Electric tension",etc is the electric potential between two different points. The unit for voltage is **Volts** which can be expressed as Joules per Coulomb (J/C). Picture below shows different types of voltages sources ( elements meant to supply voltage to a system)
