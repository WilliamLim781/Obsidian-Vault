Fundamental Law for circuits that govern the behavior of electric circuits 
$$V = IR$$ 
where V is [[Voltage]], I is [[Current]], and R is [[Resistance]].

# Ohm's law example for voltage


![[Ohm's law Voltage example.png]]
remember that $V=IR$ so to find the voltage that the source would be is $V = 200Ω * 5A$ which will make the voltage 1000V. Typically speaking the voltage source is a known value(i.e. battery or power source.) so this example isn't a problem that typically occurs unless a constant current source is used to supply the circuit.

# Ohm's law example for current


![[Ohm's law Current example.png]]
Now that Current in an unknown we need to rearrange Ohm's law to solve for Current
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$ This equation makes it so we are solving for Current instead of voltage and now when you plug in all the numbers that we have we can solve for I

$$I = \frac{12V}{600Ω}$$
which gives 0.02A or20 mA. that would go through the circuit
# Ohm's law example for resistance

The picture demonstrates the rearrangement of Ohm's law to solve for Resistance then uses the known values of Voltage and Current to solve for the value of Resistance in the resistor in Ohms.
