![[Mosfet structure.png]]The picture above demonstrates what the structure of a typical mosfet looks like. This is a n-type mosfet (also known as a NMOS) this can be concluded because of the general substrate material being a p-substrate([[body]]) and the source and the drains consist of n-type doping. The distance between the [[source]] and the [[drain]] is known as the Length denoted by L and the perpendicular distance is known as the width denoted by the W of the transistor. This diagram also mentions that in the real world the ideal length tends not to be accurate so they use $L_{eff}$ to denote the more accurate length between the source and the drain.
